# Palindrome Checker

This project is a palindrome checker built as part of a freeCodeCamp challenge. A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same forwards and backwards, ignoring punctuation, case, and spaces. The app checks whether the given input is a palindrome or not.

## Features

- An input field (`id="text-input"`) where the user can enter a word or phrase.
- A button (`id="check-btn"`) that checks if the entered text is a palindrome.
- A result display area (`id="result"`) that shows whether the input is a palindrome or not.
- Alerts the user if no input is provided.
- Handles various test cases, including spaces, punctuation, and case differences.
